# Project Architect

A comprehensive housing construction project management system built with Laravel, Livewire, TailwindCSS, and FluxUI.

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Functionality
- **Project Management**
  - Create, read, update, delete projects
  - Track project details (client, location, dates, budget)
  - Real-time progress calculation based on phase weights
  - Project status management (active, on hold, completed, cancelled)
  - Budget tracking with variance calculations

- **Phase Management**
  - Organize projects into phases (Foundation, Framing, Exterior, MEP, Interior, Final)
  - Custom weight percentages for each phase
  - Automatic progress calculation
  - Phase status tracking

- **Task Management**
  - Tasks nested under phases
  - **Click-to-toggle status** (pending â†’ in-progress â†’ completed)
  - Task weighting within phases
  - Task dependencies (predecessor/successor relationships)
  - Estimated vs actual costs and hours
  - Task assignment to users
  - Inspection status tracking

- **User Roles & Permissions**
  - Project Manager (full access)
  - Contractor (task management)
  - Client (view access)
  - Inspector (inspection marking)

- **Progress Tracking**
  - Weighted progress calculation at task, phase, and project levels
  - Real-time updates when tasks change status
  - Visual progress bars throughout the interface

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard
- Statistics overview (active projects, total tasks, my tasks, completed)
- Recent projects table with progress indicators
- Quick navigation to projects

### ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Features
- Modern, responsive design with FluxUI components
- Dark mode support
- Search and filtering on projects list
- Grid and table layouts
- Modal-based forms for create/edit operations
- Dropdown menus for actions
- Status badges with color coding
- Progress bars with smooth animations

## Database Structure

### Tables Created
1. **users** (with role field)
2. **projects** (with soft deletes)
3. **phases**
4. **tasks** (with dependencies)
5. **project_user** (pivot table)
6. **task_comments**
7. **documents** (polymorphic)

### Key Relationships
- User hasMany Projects (as manager)
- User belongsToMany Projects (team members)
- Project hasMany Phases
- Phase hasMany Tasks
- Task belongsTo User (assignee)
- Task belongsTo Task (predecessor)

## Installation & Setup

### Run Migrations and Seed Data
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

This will create:
- 4 test users with different roles
- 2 sample projects
- Multiple phases and tasks with realistic data

### Test Users
- **Project Manager**: manager@example.com / password
- **Contractor 1**: contractor1@example.com / password
- **Contractor 2**: contractor2@example.com / password
- **Client**: client@example.com / password

### Start Development Server
```bash
composer run dev
```

This will start:
- PHP development server
- Queue worker
- Log viewer (Pail)
- Vite dev server for assets

Or manually:
```bash
php artisan serve
npm run dev
```

## Key Features to Test

1. **Dashboard** (`/`)
   - View project statistics
   - See recent projects
   - Navigate to projects list

2. **Projects List** (`/projects`)
   - Create new project
   - Search and filter projects
   - Edit/delete projects
   - View project cards with progress

3. **Project Details** (`/projects/{id}`)
   - View project information
   - Add/edit/delete phases
   - Add/edit/delete tasks
   - **Click circles** to toggle task status
   - Watch progress update automatically
   - Assign tasks to users
   - Set task dependencies

## Technical Highlights

### Models with Business Logic
- `Project::calculateProgress()` - Weighted progress across phases
- `Phase::updateProgress()` - Cascading updates to project
- `Task::toggleStatus()` - Status cycle with automatic date tracking
- `Task::canStart()` - Dependency checking

### Livewire Components
- **Dashboard** - Stats and recent projects
- **Project\Index** - Projects list with CRUD operations
- **Project\Show** - Detailed project view with phases and tasks

### Progress Calculation
Progress is automatically calculated using weighted averages:
- Tasks contribute to phase progress (weighted by task weight)
- Phases contribute to project progress (weighted by phase weight)
- Updates cascade automatically when task status changes

### Click-to-Toggle Tasks
Tasks have visual status indicators:
- âšª **Pending** - Empty gray circle
- ðŸ”µ **In Progress** - Blue circle with dot
- âœ… **Completed** - Green circle with checkmark

Click any circle to cycle through statuses!
